# RealEstateDataVis
<i>Used Processing to build a visualisation which shows the change in house prices throughout the years according to borough.</i>

Use the mouse to click and drag the scroll bar which is located at the top of the screen. 
The dates range from 1996 to 2014, and the bars which tell house prices which change. 
It is possible to place your mouse on top of each bar to see the location of the borough on the map, along with the average house price in the borough in the selected year.

The data visualisation uses data provided <a href="http://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/average-house-prices-borough/resource/347f5ac3-919b-480f-bfd9-346349ab3da2" target="_blank">here</a> for the house prices and years.

The scrollbar's code was reused from a <a href="https://processing.org/examples/scrollbar.html" target="_blank">Processing example</a>. 
The <a href="http://www.gicentre.net/utils/chart" target="_blank">bar chart</a> and <a href="http://www.gicentre.net/geomap/using" target="_blank">borough map</a> uses the GI Centre libraries.
